SETUP
Test definitions and configuration will go into $HOME/.phoronix-test-suite . These files are small.
There is one CPU test and one GPU test.

The software will be installed into /phoronix-env in the container. Bind to an appropriate
location when running. The output will be written into /output in the container. Bind to an
appropriate location when running.

As an alternative to binding, you can modify the container definition prior to building to use
locations in $HOME or the current working directory as these should be automatically bound to
the container.

Instructions below assume that you have created a base directory which contains the repository,
an output directory (e.g. phoronix/<node-identifier>), and an env directory (e.g. phoronix/env).

BUILDING
Use Apptainer to build the container. (It should also work in Singularity, but this is untested.)
Root privileges should not be required. You need to build from inside the repository to enable
custom file copy.

$ cd hpcbench
$ apptainer build --fakeroot ../uq-benchmark.sif uq-benchmark.def 2>&1 | tee build.out

RUNNING
Examples of how to install and run the tests:

NVIDIA GPUs:
$ apptainer run --bind ./phoronix/h100sxm:/output --bind ./phoronix/env:/phoronix-env --nv ./uq-benchmark.sif 

AMD GPUs:
$ apptainer run --bind ./phoronix/h100sxm:/output --bind ./phoronix/env:/phoronix-env --rocm ./uq-benchmark.sif 

CPU:
(One of the tests is likely to fail due to lack of a device, this is expected)
$ apptainer run --bind ./phoronix/h100sxm:/output --bind ./phoronix/env:/phoronix-env ./uq-benchmark.sif
